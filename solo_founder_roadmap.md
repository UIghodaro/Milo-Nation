# Solo Founder Startup Roadmap
### The 5 Phases That Actually Matter First
*Lean, validated, and built to survive without a team*

---

## A Note on This Guide

This is the same full roadmap, stripped to what matters most when you're doing everything yourself. As a solo founder, your scarcest resource is time — so the framework here is ruthlessly focused on the questions that can kill your startup earliest, answered as cheaply as possible.

The five phases:

1. **Ideation** — Find a problem worth solving
2. **Validation** — Prove it before you build it
3. **MVP / Build** — Build the minimum that proves value
4. **Early Traction** — Do things that don't scale
5. **GTM** — Build a repeatable path to customers

Phases like Team, Fundraising, and Scaling are deliberately excluded — they're premature until you've proven the core. Business Model and PMF signals are woven into the phases where they're most actionable.

---

## Phase 1: Ideation
*Find a problem worth solving*

The best solo founder ideas come from one of three places: a problem you've lived personally, a market you know deeply, or a frustration you keep hearing from people around you. Don't invent a solution and work backwards — start with the pain.

### Problem Identification

- **Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)** — Ask: what "job" is someone hiring a product to do? Focus on functional, emotional, and social jobs. Interview 10 people, ask *"tell me about the last time you struggled with X"* — map the full journey, not just the moment.

- **Pain-Gain-Job Map** — For your target customer, list: pains (obstacles, frustrations), gains (desired outcomes), jobs (tasks they're trying to complete). Go where the pain is most acute.

- **Observation Journal** — Keep a running log of friction you notice in your daily life, inefficiencies in industries you know, or repeated complaints in communities you're part of. Most good ideas were hiding in plain sight for months.

### Is the Market Worth It?

You don't need a McKinsey slide on TAM. You need a directional gut-check:

- **Bottom-Up Sizing** — # of potential customers x revenue per customer per year = rough market size. If the math doesn't get interesting even in an optimistic scenario, move on.
- **Beachhead First** — Don't ask "how big is the total market?" Ask: "what's the smallest, most specific group I could win completely?" Win that first. Expand later.

### Competitive Landscape

- **2x2 Positioning Matrix** — Pick two dimensions your customer cares about most. Plot competitors. Find open space.
- **Jobs-Based Competitive Analysis** — Map what jobs competitors serve well vs. poorly. Your opening is either an overserved job (you can do it cheaper/simpler) or an underserved one (you can do it better).
- **Tools:** G2, Capterra, Reddit, App Store reviews, LinkedIn.

### Crystallise Your Hypothesis

Before moving to validation, write this down:

> *"We believe [customer segment] has [problem] because [reason]. We will solve it with [solution]. We'll know we're right if [measurable signal]."*

If you can't fill in every blank, you're not ready to validate yet.

---

## Phase 2: Validation
*Prove it before you build it*

This is the phase most solo founders skip. It's also the phase that most determines whether you waste the next 12 months. Talk to people. Not to pitch — to learn.

### Customer Discovery Interviews

Talk to 20-50 potential customers before writing a single line of code.

> **The Mom Test (Rob Fitzpatrick) — The Rules**
> - Talk about their life, not your idea
> - Ask about specifics in the past, not hypotheticals about the future
> - Talk less than 20% of the time
> - Bad: *"Would you pay for X?"* / Good: *"How much did this cost you last quarter?"*
> - Look for: emotional signals, specific stories, workarounds they've already built, money or time already spent

**How to structure interviews:**
- Open with: *"Tell me about the last time you dealt with [problem area]."*
- Follow the 5 Whys to get to root cause
- Never pitch. If they ask what you're building, say you're researching the space.
- After 10 interviews, look for patterns. Are the same frustrations coming up verbatim?

### Validation Signals That Actually Matter

Stop when you've seen most of these:
- They've already tried to solve it (spreadsheet, workaround, hired someone)
- They can quantify the cost in time or money
- They bring it up unprompted
- Multiple people describe it in almost identical words
- They ask when your solution will be ready

### Willingness to Pay

Never ask if someone would pay for something — ask for the money instead.

- **Pre-sales / Letters of Intent** — Ask for a signed LOI, a small deposit, or a credit card number. Even $1 proves more than a hundred "yes I'd use that" responses.
- **Fake Door Test** — Build a landing page with a "Sign Up" or "Buy" button. Run a small amount of paid traffic. Measure conversion. If nobody clicks, rethink.
- **Van Westendorp Price Check** — Four questions: At what price is this too expensive? A bargain? So cheap you'd doubt quality? Starting to feel expensive? Maps your acceptable price range before you've built anything.

### Riskiest Assumption Test (RAT)

Before building, name your single riskiest assumption — the one thing that, if wrong, kills the whole idea. Design the cheapest possible experiment to test it first.

> **RAT Process**
> 1. List every assumption your idea depends on
> 2. Rank by: importance x uncertainty
> 3. Pick the riskiest one
> 4. Design the smallest experiment to test it
> 5. Run it, update your beliefs, repeat

## Phase 3: MVP / Build
*The minimum that proves value*

An MVP is not a product with fewer features. It's a learning tool. The question isn't "what's the smallest thing I can ship?" — it's "what's the smallest thing that proves my core value hypothesis?"

### Scope Ruthlessly

- **Lean Canvas (Ash Maurya)** — One-page business model. Fill in: Problem, Customer Segments, Unique Value Proposition, Solution, Channels, Revenue Streams, Cost Structure, Key Metrics, Unfair Advantage. If you can't fit it on one page, it's too complex.

- **Story Mapping (Jeff Patton)** — Map the user journey end-to-end. Find the minimum vertical slice that completes the core journey. Cut everything that doesn't belong in that slice.

- **MoSCoW Method** — Sort every feature into: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have. Ship only the Must haves. Be honest — most "Must haves" are actually "Should haves".

### Build vs. No-Code vs. Fake It

| Build when... | No-code / fake when... |
|---|---|
| The tech IS the product | Testing demand before committing to build |
| No off-the-shelf option exists | Webflow / Bubble / Zapier gets you to 80% |
| You have the skills and it won't take long | You need to learn before you invest weeks |

**Solo founder no-code stack:**
- Landing page + payments: Webflow + Stripe
- Internal tools: Notion, Airtable, Retool
- Automations: Zapier, Make
- Rapid AI-assisted build: Cursor, Bolt, v0

### Define Success Before You Build

Write this down before you start:

> - **Primary metric:** The one number that tells me if this worked
> - **Success threshold:** e.g. "40% of users complete the core action in session 1"
> - **Timeframe:** I will decide by [date]
> - **Kill criteria:** If I see [X], I will stop and pivot

### A Note on Business Model

As a solo founder, nail your monetisation model early — before you build if possible. The right model changes what you build.

- **Subscription:** Predictable ARR. Requires strong retention. Good default for SaaS.
- **Usage-based:** Lower barrier to start, grows with customer success. Good if value is variable.
- **One-time purchase:** Simplest to sell, hardest to build a business on. Only works with very high volume or very high price.

**Unit economics to track from day one:**
- CAC (what does it cost to acquire a customer?)
- LTV = ARPU x Gross Margin % / Churn Rate
- Target LTV:CAC ratio of 3:1 or better before scaling

---

## Phase 4: Early Traction
*Do things that don't scale*

Your first 10-50 users should be hand-held. This is not a failure of process — it's the highest-signal research you can do. Watch them. Call them. Fix things in real time.

### Getting Your First Users

Don't build a marketing funnel yet. Just find people.

- **Your network first** — Who do you know who has this problem? Start there. This is not cheating.
- **LinkedIn DMs** — Find your ICP by job title + company type. Send a short, honest cold message. Not a pitch — a research request.
- **Reddit / Slack / Discord communities** — Go where your customer already lives. Provide genuine value first. Mention what you're building when it's relevant.
- **Cold email** — Keep it short: one line on what you're building, one line on why it's relevant to them, one ask (a 20-min call or a beta trial).

### Onboard Manually

- **Concierge MVP** — Deliver the experience by hand. If you're building a matching product, do the matching yourself. Validates that customers want the outcome before you automate it.
- **Wizard of Oz MVP** — The user thinks it's automated. It's not. Tests demand without building the full system.
- **White Glove Onboarding** — Get on a call with every early user. Watch them use the product. Don't explain — observe. Where do they hesitate? Where do they drop off?

### Fix Retention Before Acquisition

There's no point getting users if they don't come back. The leaky bucket problem kills solo founders who move to marketing too fast.

- **Retention Curve** — Plot % of users still active at Day 1, Day 7, Day 30. A curve that flattens = retention. A curve that hits zero = no PMF yet.
- **Cohort Analysis** — Are newer cohorts retaining better than older ones? If yes, your product is improving. If no, the core problem is unresolved.
- **Churn Interviews** — When someone leaves, call them. The top 3 reasons for churn are more valuable than all your activation data. Ask: *"What made you stop? What would have changed that?"*

### Finding Your Aha Moment

The aha moment is the point where a user first feels the core value. Get every new user there as fast as possible.

- **Correlation Analysis** — Compare retained vs. churned users. What did retained users do in their first session that churned users didn't?
- **Session Recordings** — Watch real sessions. Tools: Hotjar, FullStory, PostHog. Look for hesitation, confusion, drop-off.
- **Activation Funnel** — Map every step from signup to first value. The biggest drop-off point is your highest-priority fix.

### PMF Signals to Watch For

You don't need a formal PMF framework as a solo founder — you need honest answers to these questions:

- Are users coming back without you prompting them?
- Are they referring others organically?
- Do they complain when features disappear or the product goes down?
- Does the Sean Ellis test show 40%+ saying they'd be "very disappointed" if the product disappeared?

If the answer to most of these is yes, you have something. If not — go back to validation before adding growth.

## Phase 5: Go-To-Market (GTM)
*Build a repeatable path to customers*

GTM for a solo founder is about finding the one channel that works and going deep — not spreading across five channels and mastering none. This phase starts after you have retention and a clear value prop.

### Define Your ICP Tightly

The tighter your ICP, the better everything else works — your messaging, your channel choice, your conversion rate.

> **ICP Definition**
> - **Firmographic:** Company size, industry, geography, tech stack
> - **Behavioral:** How they currently solve the problem, who makes the buying decision
> - **Trigger Events:** What just happened that makes them ready to buy? (new hire, funding, regulation, competitor failure)
> - **Anti-ICP:** Who are you NOT for? Define this explicitly or you'll waste time on the wrong customers.

### Channel Discovery — Pick One, Go Deep

Run small experiments across 3-4 channels. After 4-6 weeks, double down on the one showing the best signal. As a solo founder, you don't have the bandwidth to run multiple channels well.

- **Content / SEO** — Long-term compounding. Best when buyers are actively searching. Takes 6-12 months. High leverage for solo founders because it works while you sleep.
- **Cold Outbound** — LinkedIn or email. Fast feedback loop. Works best for B2B with a defined ICP. Requires a tight message and honest personalisation.
- **Community-Led** — Go where your ICP lives. Provide value consistently before pitching. Works well when your customers self-identify in a community.
- **Product-Led Growth (PLG)** — The product drives its own acquisition (sharing, invites, viral loops). Requires the product to have inherent shareability. Low CAC, scales well solo.
- **Partnerships** — Find products your ICP already uses. Propose a co-marketing or referral arrangement. Can unlock distribution without ad spend.

### Positioning & Messaging

Good positioning makes every channel more effective. It's the foundation, not an afterthought.

> **April Dunford's Framework (Obviously Awesome)**
> 1. What would customers do if you didn't exist? (competitive alternative)
> 2. What do you have that alternatives don't? (unique attribute)
> 3. What value does that uniqueness create?
> 4. Who cares most about that value? (refined ICP)
> 5. What category do you belong to — or are you creating?

**Solo founder messaging checklist:**
- One sentence that says what you are and who it's for
- One primary benefit, specific to your ICP
- Three concrete proof points
- One clear CTA

### Launch Strategy

You don't need a big launch. You need a repeatable motion that gets you in front of the right people regularly.

- **Product Hunt** — Good for B2B SaaS and dev tools. Build your hunter following before launch day. Coordinate timing carefully.
- **Waitlist / Staged Beta** — Build FOMO pre-launch. Use early access to collect testimonials for the public launch.
- **Niche Press / Newsletters** — Identify 3-5 journalists or newsletter writers who cover your exact space. Offer an exclusive angle, not a press release.

## The Through-Line

As a solo founder, these five phases have one underlying logic: **learn before you spend.** Every phase is about reducing the cost of being wrong.

- Ideation is about picking the right problem before investing time
- Validation is about proving demand before investing in code
- MVP is about proving value before investing in growth
- Early Traction is about proving retention before investing in acquisition
- GTM is about proving a channel before investing in scale

When in doubt, go back one phase. The most common mistake is moving forward when the current phase isn't resolved.

*Keep it lean. Stay close to customers. Good luck.*
