# Build Decision
**Phase:** 3 — MVP / Build | **Module:** 2 of 3

---

## Purpose

Determines the right approach for building the MVP — full custom build, no-code tools, or a manual/fake version. The wrong choice here costs weeks. Most solo founders over-build when they should be faking.

**Use when:**
- You've defined your MVP scope and need to decide how to build it
- You're tempted to write custom code before you've proven demand
- You need to move fast and want to know what you can safely shortcut

## Frameworks & Tools

**The Build vs. Fake Decision Matrix**

| Signal | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Core value IS the technology (e.g. an algorithm, AI model) | Build |
| No off-the-shelf tool exists for the core function | Build |
| You have the technical skills and it takes <2 weeks | Build |
| You're testing demand before committing to build | Fake / No-code |
| A no-code tool gets you to 80% of the experience | No-code |
| The workflow can be done manually to prove the outcome | Concierge / Wizard of Oz |

**Concierge MVP**
Deliver the full product experience manually — no automation. You do the work a product would eventually do. Validates that customers want the *outcome* before you invest in automating the delivery. Example: if you're building an AI research tool, do the research yourself first.

**Wizard of Oz MVP**
The user interacts with what appears to be a working product. Behind the scenes, a human (you) is doing the work. Tests the full experience without building the backend. Requires a convincing enough front-end that users don't notice.

**No-Code Stack for Solo Founders**
- Landing page + payments: Webflow + Stripe
- Database / internal tools: Airtable, Notion, Retool
- Automations: Zapier, Make (Integromat)
- Forms and surveys: Typeform, Tally
- Rapid AI-assisted build: Cursor, Bolt, v0 (for when you do need to write code fast)
- Mobile prototype: Glide, Adalo

**The 2-Week Rule**
If your MVP will take more than 2 weeks to build, it's over-scoped. Go back to scope definition and cut until you're under 2 weeks. Speed of learning is the only competitive advantage at this stage.
