# Channel Strategy
**Phase:** 6 — GTM | **Module:** 3 of 4

---

## Purpose

Identifies the one or two acquisition channels that work for your specific product and ICP, through systematic experimentation. Most startups succeed through depth in 1-2 channels — not breadth across many. This module tells you how to find yours.

**Use when:**
- You're ready to move from manual user acquisition to repeatable growth
- You have a clear ICP and value proposition
- You need to decide where to focus your limited time and budget

## Frameworks & Tools

**Bullseye Framework (Gabriel Weinberg — Traction)**
19 traction channels exist. Most won't work for your business. The process:
1. Brainstorm all 19 channels and note which seem plausible
2. Run cheap experiments on your top 3-5 candidates (1-2 week sprints, small budget)
3. Double down on the 1-2 that show the best signal
4. Go deep — most companies that succeed dominate one channel before adding others

The channel that worked for a competitor may not work for you. Test, don't assume.

**Channel-ICP Fit**
Match channel to how your ICP discovers and evaluates solutions:

| ICP Behaviour | Channel |
|---|---|
| Actively searching for a solution | SEO / Google Ads |
| Learning in communities | Community-led, Reddit, LinkedIn |
| Being sold to at work | Outbound sales, LinkedIn outreach |
| Discovering through products they already use | PLG, integrations, partnerships |
| Reading industry content | Content marketing, newsletters |

**Channel Experiment Template**
For each channel you test, define before you start: budget, timeframe, primary metric, success threshold. After the experiment: actual result vs. threshold, CAC estimate, qualitative signal. Kill channels that miss threshold. Invest in channels that beat it.

**Product-Led Growth (PLG)**
The product drives its own acquisition through shareability, viral loops, or network effects. Requires the product to have an inherent reason to be shared or to create value for others. Low CAC at scale. Examples: Figma (share to collaborate), Calendly (send a link to book), Notion (publish pages publicly). Ask: is there a natural moment in my product where a user would want to show or share it?

**Content / SEO**
Long-term compounding channel. Best when your ICP is actively searching for solutions or information. Takes 6-12 months to show meaningful results. High leverage for solo founders — content works while you sleep. Start with bottom-of-funnel keywords (high intent, lower volume) before top-of-funnel.

**Outbound Sales**
Fast feedback loop, works well for B2B with a tight ICP and high ACV. Requires: a good list (Apollo, Clay, LinkedIn Sales Navigator), personalised messaging, and a clear value prop. Don't outsource this early — founders should do the first 20-50 outbound conversations themselves.
