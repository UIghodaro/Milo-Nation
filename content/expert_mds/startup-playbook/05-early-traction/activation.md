# Activation
**Phase:** 5 — Early Traction | **Module:** 4 of 4

---

## Purpose

Identifies the "aha moment" — the point in the user journey where someone first experiences the core value of your product — and engineers the fastest path to it. Activation is the bridge between acquisition and retention. If users don't activate, they won't retain.

**Use when:**
- You have users but retention is low
- You're trying to understand why users sign up but don't come back
- You want to find the specific action that predicts long-term retention

## Frameworks & Tools

**Aha Moment Discovery**
Compare retained users vs. churned users. What actions did retained users take in their first session that churned users didn't? Look for a specific action (not just "logged in") that strongly correlates with long-term retention. This is your aha moment. Famous examples: Facebook found "7 friends in 10 days", Slack found "2,000 messages sent within a team", Twitter found "following 30 accounts".

**Activation Funnel Mapping**
Map every step between signup and the aha moment:
1. Signed up
2. Completed profile / setup
3. [Core action 1]
4. [Core action 2]
5. Reached aha moment

Calculate the drop-off % at each step. The largest drop-off is your highest-priority fix. Reduce friction at that step before anything else.

**Time-to-Value Optimisation**
Measure how long it takes from signup to first value delivery. Every minute of delay increases the chance the user leaves. Tactics: remove unnecessary setup steps, provide instant sample data or templates, offer a guided first-run experience, send a triggered email at the point where drop-off is highest.

**Onboarding Email Sequences**
A triggered email sequence during the first 7 days is one of the highest-ROI onboarding investments. Each email should correspond to a step in the activation funnel. If a user hasn't completed Step 2, send an email that helps them do it. Don't send generic newsletters to people who haven't activated yet — it signals you don't know where they are.

**Empty State Design**
The empty state (what a new user sees before they've done anything) is one of the most important UX moments in activation. Show them exactly what to do first. Provide sample content, a guided tour, or a single clear CTA. A blank screen is a churn machine.
