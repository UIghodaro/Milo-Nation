# User Acquisition (Early)
**Phase:** 5 — Early Traction | **Module:** 1 of 4

---

## Purpose

Gets your first 10-50 users through non-scalable, direct means. This is not marketing — it's manual outreach and community presence. The goal is real users fast, not a repeatable channel. Channels come in Phase 6.

**Use when:**
- Your MVP is live and you need your first users
- You haven't yet found a repeatable acquisition channel
- You want high-quality early users who will give honest feedback

## Frameworks & Tools

**Network First**
Your personal and professional network is your fastest path to first users. Who do you know who has the problem you're solving? Don't be precious about this — it's not cheating to start with people you know. The goal is learning, and known contacts give faster, more honest feedback than strangers.

**LinkedIn Outreach**
Filter by ICP job title + company type + geography. Send a short, honest cold message — not a pitch. Template: *"I'm building [X] for [ICP] and talking to people who deal with [problem]. Would you be open to a 20-min call? Not selling anything — genuinely trying to understand how people handle this."* Personalise one line per message. Volume matters but not at the expense of relevance.

**Community Seeding**
Identify the 3-5 communities (Reddit, Slack, Discord, Facebook Groups, LinkedIn Groups) where your ICP already spends time. Spend 2-4 weeks providing genuine value — answering questions, sharing insights — before mentioning your product. When you do mention it, frame it as a tool you built to solve a problem the community knows.

**Cold Email**
Keep it under 100 words: one sentence on what you've built, one sentence on why it's relevant to them specifically, one low-friction ask (beta access, a quick call, feedback). Subject line should be specific to their context, not generic. Tools: Apollo, Hunter, Clay for finding emails.

**Paid Seeding (Small Budget)**
£50-100 on a targeted Facebook or LinkedIn ad pointing to a waitlist or landing page. Not for scale — for signal. If you can't get any signups at small spend, the messaging or ICP targeting needs work before investing further.
