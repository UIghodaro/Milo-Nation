# Willingness to Pay
**Phase:** 2 — Validation | **Module:** 3 of 4

---

## Purpose

Tests whether people will exchange real value (money, commitment, time) for your solution — before you've built it. Verbal enthusiasm is not a signal. Actual commitment is.

**Use when:**
- You've validated the problem is real and frequent
- You need to test whether it's monetisable before investing in building
- You're deciding on your pricing model and need early anchoring data

## Frameworks & Tools

**Pre-Sales / Deposits**
Ask for money before you've built anything. This can be: a signed letter of intent, a small deposit, a credit card charge for "early access", or a paid pilot agreement. The number doesn't matter much — the act of paying does. A single paying customer is more valuable evidence than 100 enthusiastic interviewees.

**Fake Door Test**
Build a landing page describing the solution. Add a real CTA (sign up, buy, join waitlist). Run a small amount of paid traffic or post it in communities. Measure: click-through rate on the CTA, conversion rate to signup, and — if you have a payment step — conversion to payment. If the numbers are dismal, revisit the problem or the framing before building.

**Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter**
Four survey questions that map the acceptable price range:
1. At what price is this too expensive to consider?
2. At what price is this starting to feel expensive but you'd still consider it?
3. At what price is this a bargain — great value?
4. At what price is it so cheap you'd doubt the quality?

Plot the crossover points to find your optimal price range. Run this with 20+ people for statistical meaningfulness.

**Value Metric Discovery**
Ask: *"What would make this worth 10x more to you?"* and *"What would make this worth 10x less?"* The answers reveal what customers actually value — and give you the foundation for value-based pricing rather than cost-plus guessing.

**Letters of Intent (LOIs)**
For B2B, a signed LOI is a strong signal. It doesn't need to be legally binding — even an email saying "we'd commit £X/year to this if it existed" is meaningful evidence when you have 5-10 of them.
