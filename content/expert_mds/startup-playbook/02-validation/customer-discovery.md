# Customer Discovery
**Phase:** 2 — Validation | **Module:** 1 of 4

---

## Purpose

Gathers direct evidence from real humans about the problem before you build anything. The goal is not to pitch — it's to learn whether the problem you identified actually exists at the scale and intensity you assumed.

**Use when:**
- You have a hypothesis and need to test whether the problem is real
- You haven't yet spoken to 20+ potential customers
- You're tempted to start building — stop and do this first

## Frameworks & Tools

**The Mom Test (Rob Fitzpatrick)**
The core framework for running discovery interviews without getting lied to. Rules: talk about their life not your idea, ask about the past not the future, listen more than you talk. Key questions: *"How do you currently handle X?"*, *"Tell me about the last time this happened"*, *"What have you tried to fix it?"*. Never ask: *"Would you use this?"* or *"Would you pay for this?"* — the answers are meaningless.

**JTBD Discovery Interview**
Structure: open with *"Tell me about the last time you dealt with [problem area]"*, follow with 5 Whys to reach root cause, then map the full job: situation → motivation → expected outcome. Don't lead the witness. The interview is a listening exercise, not a validation exercise.

**Empathy Map (IDEO/Strategyzer)**
After each batch of interviews, map what customers Say, Think, Do, and Feel. The most valuable signals are gaps between what they say and what they actually do — those gaps reveal the real problem beneath the stated one.

**Interview Synthesis**
After 10 interviews, look for patterns: are the same frustrations surfacing verbatim across multiple people? Are they describing the same workarounds? Verbatim repetition is signal. One person's strong opinion is noise.

**Recruiting interviewees:**
- Your personal network (fastest)
- LinkedIn — filter by job title, send honest cold messages ("I'm researching X, not selling anything")
- Reddit / Slack communities — ask for 20-min conversations
- Existing customers of adjacent products
