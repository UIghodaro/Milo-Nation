# Assumption Testing (RAT)
**Phase:** 2 — Validation | **Module:** 4 of 4

---

## Purpose

Isolates and tests your single riskiest assumption as cheaply and quickly as possible. Traditional MVPs test too much at once. The Riskiest Assumption Test (RAT) forces you to identify the one thing that, if wrong, kills the entire idea — and test it first.

**Use when:**
- You've completed discovery and WTP validation
- You're about to commit to building an MVP and want to reduce risk first
- You have multiple competing hypotheses and need a way to prioritise

## Frameworks & Tools

**Riskiest Assumption Test (RAT) Process**
1. List every assumption your business model depends on
2. Rank by: importance to success × certainty (low certainty = high risk)
3. Identify the single most important + least certain assumption
4. Design the smallest, cheapest experiment that could falsify it
5. Run it, collect data, update your belief
6. Move to the next riskiest assumption

**Assumption Categories to Map**
- *Desirability:* Do customers want this? Will they use it?
- *Viability:* Can we build a business on it? (pricing, CAC, LTV)
- *Feasibility:* Can we actually build this with available resources?
- *Adaptability:* Will this still be relevant in 2 years?

**Experiment Design Toolkit**
Match the experiment type to the assumption you're testing:
- *Landing page + CTA:* Tests desirability and willingness to pay
- *Concierge / manual service:* Tests whether the outcome is valuable (before automating)
- *Wizard of Oz:* Tests the full product experience without building the backend
- *Smoke test ad:* Tests whether you can reach and convert your ICP cost-effectively
- *Prototype / mockup walkthrough:* Tests usability and comprehension without functional code

**Defining Pass/Fail Before You Run**
Write down: "This experiment passes if [specific metric] reaches [specific threshold] within [specific timeframe]." If you don't define the bar before you run the test, you'll rationalise any result as positive. Define your kill criteria in advance.

**Minimum Success Criteria (MSC)**
Ask: what's the minimum result that would give you enough confidence to proceed? Not the best-case scenario — the floor. If the experiment hits the floor, proceed. If it doesn't, pivot or reframe before investing further.
