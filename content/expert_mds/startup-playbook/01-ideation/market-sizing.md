# Market Sizing
**Phase:** 1 — Ideation | **Module:** 2 of 4

---

## Purpose

Determines whether a problem is worth solving at a business scale. Not every real problem is a real market. This module gives you a directional answer — not false precision — before you invest further.

**Use when:**
- You've identified a candidate problem and want to sanity-check the opportunity size
- You need to decide between two problem areas
- You're preparing for early investor conversations

## Frameworks & Tools

**Bottom-Up Sizing (preferred)**
Build from first principles: # of potential customers × average revenue per customer per year = addressable market. Forces honest assumptions and is far more credible than top-down. Example: 200,000 UK e-commerce businesses × £600/yr = £120M SAM.

**TAM / SAM / SOM**
- *TAM (Total Addressable Market):* Everyone who could theoretically buy
- *SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):* The segment you can realistically reach
- *SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):* What you could win in 2-3 years

Focus your energy on SAM and SOM. TAM is for narratives; SOM is for planning.

**Top-Down Sizing**
Start with an industry report figure and carve out your segment. Use as a cross-check against bottom-up, not as your primary method. Industry reports are often stale, over-aggregated, and don't reflect your specific niche.

**Beachhead Market Strategy (Geoffrey Moore)**
Don't size the full market — size the smallest, most specific segment you could dominate first. A £5M beachhead you can own 30% of is more valuable than a £5B TAM you can't get traction in.

**Proxy Markets**
When direct data doesn't exist, use analogous markets as proxies. Look for a comparable product that solved a comparable problem for a comparable customer. Use their growth trajectory as a reference point, adjusted for your context.
