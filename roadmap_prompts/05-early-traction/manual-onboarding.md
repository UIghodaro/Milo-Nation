# Manual Onboarding
**Phase:** 5 — Early Traction | **Module:** 2 of 4

---

## Purpose

Hand-holds every early user through the product experience individually. This is deliberately not scalable. The payoff is understanding exactly where your product succeeds, fails, and confuses — information you can't get from analytics alone at this stage.

**Use when:**
- You have your first 10-50 users and want to maximise learning from them
- Your activation or retention is low and you don't know why
- You want to find the "aha moment" before trying to automate toward it

## Frameworks & Tools

**Concierge Onboarding**
Schedule a live call with every new user. Walk them through setup, watch them interact with the product in real time, and take notes on where they hesitate, ask questions, or look confused. Don't explain — observe. Only help when they get completely stuck. The friction points you observe are your highest-priority product fixes.

**Wizard of Oz**
For parts of the product that aren't built yet, fake the automation. The user gets the experience; you do the work manually behind the scenes. Validates the value of the outcome without requiring the full technical solution. Be transparent once you have enough signal and are ready to build the real version.

**Session Recording Review**
Use Hotjar, FullStory, or PostHog to record real sessions. Watch 20-30 recordings end-to-end. You'll find patterns within the first 10 that your analytics would take months to surface — rage clicks, repeated back-and-forths, features nobody finds, and steps nobody completes.

**First Session Checklist**
Define the exact sequence of actions a user should take in their first session to reach the "aha moment". Track completion of each step. Identify the single biggest drop-off. Fix that before anything else.

**The Setup Tax**
Every piece of friction in onboarding (form fields, required uploads, mandatory profile completion, permission requests) reduces activation. Audit your onboarding for "setup tax" — every step that delays the user from reaching value. Remove or defer anything that isn't essential to the first session.
