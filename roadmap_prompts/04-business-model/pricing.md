# Pricing
**Phase:** 4 — Business Model | **Module:** 3 of 3

## Purpose

Sets the right price for your product — one that reflects the value you deliver, converts prospects, and builds a sustainable business. Most solo founders underprice. Price is a positioning signal, not just a revenue lever.

**Use when:**
- You're launching your first paid tier and need to set prices
- You're seeing poor conversion and want to test whether pricing is the issue
- You're evolving from a flat fee to a more sophisticated model

## Frameworks & Tools

**Value-Based Pricing**
Price based on the value you deliver to the customer, not on your costs or competitor prices. If your product saves a business £50K/year, charging £5K/year is a 10x ROI — and your price should reflect that, not your server costs. To apply it: quantify the value your product creates (time saved, revenue generated, cost avoided), then price at 10-20% of that value.

**Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter**
Four survey questions that reveal the acceptable price range (see Willingness to Pay module). Plot the four response curves to find the "acceptable price range" — the band between the point where too many people find it too cheap (quality concern) and too expensive (rejection). Set your price within this band.

**Price Anchoring**
Present a higher-tier plan first. The mid-tier option feels like a bargain by comparison. This "decoy effect" reliably increases average revenue per user. Most SaaS pricing pages use three tiers precisely for this reason — the middle tier is the real target.

**The Pricing Page Test**
Before committing to a model, run a fake pricing page: show your intended pricing to 20-30 potential customers (via landing page or direct conversation) and observe reactions. Are they scrolling to the cheapest option? Asking what's included in the mid tier? Not reacting to price at all? Each response tells you something different.

**Cohort Pricing Experiments**
Once live, assign new signups randomly to different price points. Measure: conversion rate, trial-to-paid rate, churn rate, and LTV by cohort. Optimise for LTV, not conversion rate — a lower conversion rate at a higher price often produces better LTV.

**Common Pricing Mistakes**
- Pricing too low because you're not confident in the value
- Copying a competitor's pricing without understanding their unit economics
- Charging per seat when value scales with usage (or vice versa)
- Never testing price — treating it as fixed after launch
