# Unit Economics
**Phase:** 4 — Business Model | **Module:** 2 of 3

## Purpose

Determines whether your business model is structurally sound — whether each customer you acquire is worth more than they cost to acquire and serve. Bad unit economics at small scale become catastrophic at large scale.

**Use when:**
- You're moving from free to paid and need to model sustainability
- You're considering paid acquisition channels and need to know your limits
- You're preparing for investor conversations

## Frameworks & Tools

**Core Unit Economics Formulas**

*CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)*
Total sales & marketing spend ÷ number of new customers acquired in the same period.
Include everything: ad spend, tools, your own time at an imputed hourly rate.

*LTV (Lifetime Value)*
ARPU × Gross Margin % ÷ Monthly Churn Rate
Or for simple cases: average revenue per customer × average customer lifespan.

*LTV:CAC Ratio*
The fundamental health check. Target: 3:1 or better. Below 1:1 means you're destroying value with every customer acquired. Between 1:1 and 3:1 means marginal — revisit pricing or reduce CAC.

*CAC Payback Period*
CAC ÷ (ARPU × Gross Margin %). How many months until a customer has paid back their acquisition cost. Target: under 12 months. Over 18 months creates serious cash flow risk.

**Gross Margin Benchmarks**
- Pure software (SaaS): 70-85%
- AI/LLM-heavy products: 50-70% (model costs reduce margin)
- Marketplace: 40-70%
- Service-heavy: 20-50%

If your gross margin is below 50%, scaling the business requires significant capital. Factor this into your growth planning.

**Contribution Margin**
Revenue minus variable costs (hosting, payment processing, support). The amount each customer contributes to covering fixed costs. Must be positive before you can scale.

**Cohort-Based Unit Economics**
Don't just measure average LTV — measure it by cohort (customers acquired in the same month). Are newer cohorts worth more or less than older ones? If LTV is declining by cohort, your product or market is deteriorating. If it's improving, your product is getting better.
