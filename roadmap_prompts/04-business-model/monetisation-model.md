# Monetisation Model
**Phase:** 4 — Business Model | **Module:** 1 of 3

---

## Purpose

Defines how you capture value from the problem you're solving. The monetisation model isn't just a pricing decision — it shapes what you build, how you sell, and what your unit economics look like. Choosing the wrong model early creates compounding problems.

**Use when:**
- You're building your MVP and need to decide how you'll charge
- You're moving from free beta to paid and need a model
- You're evaluating whether your current model fits your product and customer

## Frameworks & Tools

**Model Selection by Context**

| Model | Best for | Watch out for |
|---|---|---|
| Subscription (SaaS) | Recurring software value, B2B, habit-forming tools | Requires strong retention to be viable |
| Usage-based | Variable value delivery (APIs, AI, infrastructure) | Revenue unpredictability, hard to forecast |
| One-time purchase | High-value tools, templates, courses | Hard to build recurring revenue on |
| Freemium | Products with viral loops or network effects | Free users dominate support costs; 2-5% conversion typical |
| Marketplace (take rate) | Connecting buyers and sellers | Cold start problem; requires both sides |
| Services / retainer | Early-stage before productisation | Hard to scale; founder bottleneck |

**The Value Metric**
The most important decision in your model: what do you charge *per*? This is your value metric — the unit that scales with the value your customer gets. Examples: per seat, per transaction, per API call, per GB, per outcome. Charge per something that grows as customer value grows.

**Land and Expand**
Design your model so customers start small and grow. A low entry price reduces friction to start. Built-in expansion mechanics (more seats, more usage, more features) increase revenue without re-selling. The best B2B SaaS models have a negative net revenue churn — revenue from expansion exceeds revenue lost to churn.

**Annual vs. Monthly**
Annual plans improve cash flow, reduce churn, and give you runway. Offer a discount (typically 2 months free = 17% off) for annual commitment. Most SaaS companies see 40-60% of customers choose annual when it's clearly presented. Build this into your pricing page from day one.
