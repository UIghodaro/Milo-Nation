# Problem Validation
**Phase:** 2 — Validation | **Module:** 2 of 4

---

## Purpose

Determines whether the problem you've discovered is real, frequent, and painful enough to build a business on. Discovery tells you the problem exists. Validation tells you whether it's worth solving.

**Use when:**
- You've completed customer discovery interviews
- You need to decide whether to proceed to MVP or pivot your hypothesis
- You want an objective framework for evaluating what you've learned

## Frameworks & Tools

**Problem Validation Scorecard**
Rate each candidate problem across five dimensions:
- *Frequency:* Does it happen daily/weekly (strong) or monthly/annually (weak)?
- *Intensity:* Is it genuinely painful, or just mildly inconvenient?
- *Workaround existence:* Have people built their own fix? (Strong signal — means the problem is real and current solutions are inadequate)
- *Quantifiable cost:* Can people put a number on it (time, money, missed revenue)?
- *Accessibility:* Can you reach enough of these customers efficiently?

**Demand Signal Checklist**
You're looking for most of these before proceeding:
- They've already tried to solve it (spreadsheet, workaround, hired someone)
- They bring it up unprompted — you don't have to lead them there
- Multiple people describe it in almost identical words
- They ask when your solution will be ready
- They volunteer to be a beta user without being asked

**The "Already Spending" Test**
The strongest validation signal is that people are already spending money or significant time on the problem. If they've hired a freelancer, bought a tool, or built an internal solution — even an imperfect one — that's more convincing than anything they could say in an interview.

**Anti-Patterns to Watch For**
- Polite enthusiasm ("that sounds interesting") without any of the demand signals above
- People who can't remember the last time the problem occurred
- Nobody has a current workaround (often means the problem isn't painful enough)
- Every interviewee describes the problem differently (means you haven't found the real job yet)
