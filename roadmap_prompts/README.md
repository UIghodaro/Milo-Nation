# Startup Playbook
### 6 Phases · 19 Modules · Solo Founder Edition

Each module is a standalone skill file — a discrete unit of work with its own purpose and frameworks. No module bleeds into another.

## Module Structure

Every module has two sections:

1. **Purpose** — What problem this module solves and when to use it
2. **Frameworks & Tools** — The methods and models to apply

---

## Sequence

```
[1. IDEATION]
problem-identification → market-sizing → competitive-analysis → hypothesis-formation

[2. VALIDATION]
customer-discovery → problem-validation → willingness-to-pay → assumption-testing

[3. MVP / BUILD]
scope-definition + build-decision + success-metrics (run in parallel)

[4. BUSINESS MODEL]
monetisation-model → unit-economics → pricing (can run alongside MVP)

[5. EARLY TRACTION]
user-acquisition → manual-onboarding → retention-analysis → activation

[6. GTM]
icp-definition → positioning-messaging → channel-strategy → launch
```

**Rule:** When in doubt, go back one phase. Moving forward before the current phase is resolved is the most common solo founder mistake.
