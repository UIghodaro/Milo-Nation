# Scope Definition
**Phase:** 3 — MVP / Build | **Module:** 1 of 3

---

## Purpose

Defines the absolute minimum feature set that proves your core value hypothesis — and nothing more. Scope creep is the primary reason MVPs take too long, cost too much, and test the wrong things.

**Use when:**
- You've validated the problem and are ready to define what to build
- You have a feature list that's grown beyond control
- You want a framework for making ruthless scoping decisions

## Frameworks & Tools

**Lean Canvas (Ash Maurya)**
One-page business model that forces prioritisation before a single line of code is written. Fill in: Problem, Customer Segments, Unique Value Proposition, Solution, Channels, Revenue Streams, Cost Structure, Key Metrics, Unfair Advantage. If you can't fill every box concisely, your thinking isn't clear enough yet. The UVP box is the most important — it defines what the MVP must prove.

**User Story Mapping (Jeff Patton)**
Map the user's core journey horizontally (the narrative spine). Then slice it vertically to find the minimum slice that completes the journey end-to-end. This minimum vertical slice is your MVP scope. Everything else is v2.

**MoSCoW Method**
Sort every candidate feature into four buckets:
- *Must have:* The MVP fails without this
- *Should have:* Important but not required for v1
- *Could have:* Nice to have if time allows
- *Won't have:* Out of scope for now

Be honest — most "Must haves" are actually "Should haves". If removing a feature wouldn't break the core value delivery, it's not a Must have.

**RICE Scoring**
For each feature: Reach (how many users affected?) × Impact (how much does it move the needle?) × Confidence (how sure are you?) ÷ Effort (how long does it take?). Rank by score. Build the top of the list first. Cut the bottom.

**The Value Hypothesis Test**
Ask of every feature: "Does this directly test whether customers get value from the core product?" If no — cut it. The MVP's job is to prove the value hypothesis, not to be a complete product.
