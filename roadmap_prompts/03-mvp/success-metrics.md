# Success Metrics
**Phase:** 3 — MVP / Build | **Module:** 3 of 3

---

## Purpose

Defines what "working" looks like before you start building, so you can make a clean go/no-go decision when the MVP launches. Without pre-defined metrics, every result gets rationalised as positive.

**Use when:**
- You've decided what to build and how to build it
- You need to define the success criteria before launch
- You want to avoid the trap of moving goalposts after you see results

## Frameworks & Tools

**Metric Definition Template**
Write this down before a single line of code:
- *Primary metric:* The one number that tells you if the MVP succeeded
- *Success threshold:* The minimum value that constitutes a pass (e.g. "30% of users complete the core action")
- *Timeframe:* The date by which you will make a decision
- *Kill criteria:* The result that causes you to stop and pivot

**The One Metric That Matters (OMTM)**
At any given stage, identify the single most important metric to focus on. For an MVP, this is usually: do users complete the core value action? Everything else is secondary. Measuring too many things at once creates noise and diffuses focus.

**Leading vs. Lagging Indicators**
- *Lagging:* Revenue, retention, NPS — these tell you what happened
- *Leading:* Activation rate, feature engagement, session depth — these predict what will happen

For an MVP, focus on leading indicators that signal whether users are finding value, since you won't have enough lagging data yet.

**Baseline Benchmarks**
Know what good looks like before you launch:
- Activation rate (completed core action in first session): aim for >40%
- Day 7 retention: aim for >20% for consumer, >30% for B2B
- NPS: directionally positive (>20) as early signal

**Instrumentation Before Launch**
You can't measure what you don't track. Before launching, instrument:
- Signup and onboarding funnel (every step)
- Core action completion
- Session frequency and depth
- Drop-off points

Tools: PostHog (open source), Mixpanel, Amplitude, or even a manual spreadsheet for very early stage.
