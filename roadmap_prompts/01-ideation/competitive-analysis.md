# Competitive Analysis
**Phase:** 1 — Ideation | **Module:** 3 of 4

---

## Purpose

Maps who already operates in your space, how they're positioned, and where the gaps are. The goal isn't to prove you have no competition — it's to find your opening and sharpen your differentiation before you build.

**Use when:**
- You've identified a problem and want to understand the existing solution landscape
- You need to find your positioning angle
- You're assessing whether the market is too crowded or ripe for disruption

## Frameworks & Tools

**2×2 Positioning Matrix**
Pick the two dimensions your target customer cares about most (e.g. price vs. power, simplicity vs. flexibility, self-serve vs. high-touch). Plot every competitor. The open quadrant is your target position. If there's no open quadrant, you need a different pair of axes — or a different market.

**Jobs-Based Competitive Analysis**
Map competitors by which customer jobs they serve well vs. poorly. Your opening is one of two things: an overserved job (incumbents over-engineer it — you can do it cheaper/simpler) or an underserved job (incumbents ignore it — you can do it better). The Innovator's Dilemma dynamic almost always starts with one of these.

**Feature-Benefit Gap Analysis**
List every major competitor. For each, note: what they do well, what they do poorly, and what their customers complain about most (use G2/Capterra/Reddit reviews). The recurring complaints across multiple competitors point to a structural gap — not just one company's failure.

**Porter's Five Forces**
Assess the structural dynamics of the market: threat of new entrants, bargaining power of buyers, bargaining power of suppliers, threat of substitutes, and competitive rivalry. Use it to understand whether this market is structurally attractive or if you'd be swimming upstream from day one.
