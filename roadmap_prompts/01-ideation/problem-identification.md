# Problem Identification
**Phase:** 1 — Ideation | **Module:** 1 of 4

---

## Purpose

Surfaces genuine, painful, frequent problems before you commit time or money to anything else. Most failed startups solved the wrong problem — or a problem nobody cared urgently enough to pay for.

**Use when:**
- Starting from scratch and need to find an idea
- You have a vague concept but haven't confirmed the underlying pain
- You want to stress-test whether a problem is real before moving to validation

## Frameworks & Tools

**Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)**
Ask: what "job" is someone hiring a product to do? Every job has three dimensions — functional (what they're doing), emotional (how they want to feel), social (how they want to appear). The strongest problems frustrate across all three. Interview with: *"Tell me about the last time you struggled with X"* and map the full journey, not just the surface complaint.

**Pain-Gain-Job Map (Strategyzer)**
For any target customer, list: Pains (obstacles, frustrations, risks), Gains (desired outcomes), Jobs (tasks they're trying to complete). Best opportunities sit where pain is acute, gains are highly desired, and the current solution is poor.

**5 Whys**
When you find a surface frustration, ask "why" five times to reach root cause. The root cause is usually what's worth solving — not the symptom people first describe.

**Frequency × Intensity × Solution Quality**
Score each candidate problem: how often it occurs × how much it hurts × how poorly it's currently solved. High across all three = strong signal. Frequent but mild, or intense but rare, usually isn't worth pursuing.

**Observation Journal**
Log friction you encounter in daily life, inefficiencies in industries you know, or repeated complaints in communities you're in. Most strong ideas were hiding in plain sight for months before the founder noticed.

**Where to look:**
- Reddit ("I hate that...", "why is there no...", "I wish...")
- App Store / G2 / Capterra 2-3 star reviews
- Niche Slack / Discord communities
- Your own professional frustrations
