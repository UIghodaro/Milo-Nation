# Hypothesis Formation
**Phase:** 1 — Ideation | **Module:** 4 of 4

---

## Purpose

Converts your problem intuition into a testable statement. A hypothesis isn't a business plan — it's a falsifiable claim that tells you exactly what you need to prove (or disprove) in validation. Without this, you can't run a real experiment.

**Use when:**
- You've done enough problem exploration and competitive analysis to have a point of view
- You're ready to move into validation and need to define what you're testing
- You want to force clarity on your assumptions before committing to a direction

## Frameworks & Tools

**The Hypothesis Stack**
Write your core hypothesis in this format:
> *"We believe [specific customer segment] experiences [specific problem] when [context]. We will solve it by [solution approach]. We'll know we're right if [measurable signal] within [timeframe]."*

Every blank must be fillable. Vague inputs produce unvalidatable hypotheses.

**Assumption Mapping (Strategyzer)**
List every assumption your hypothesis depends on. Map them on two axes: importance (how critical is this to your model?) × certainty (how confident are you?). The high-importance, low-certainty assumptions are your critical risks — and your validation targets.

**Jobs Story Format**
Frame your hypothesis from the customer's perspective:
> *"When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]."*
This forces you to articulate the problem from the inside out, not from a product-first perspective.

**Falsifiability Check**
A good hypothesis can be proven wrong. Ask: what evidence would make me abandon this idea? If you can't answer that, you don't have a hypothesis — you have a belief you're protecting. Define your kill criteria before you start testing.

**The Riskiest Assumption**
Of all your assumptions, identify the single one that, if wrong, makes the entire idea unworkable. That's what you test first in validation — not the easiest assumption, the riskiest one.
