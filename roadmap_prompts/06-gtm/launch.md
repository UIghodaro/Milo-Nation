# Launch
**Phase:** 6 — GTM | **Module:** 4 of 4

---

## Purpose

Generates initial momentum through a structured public launch — building awareness, acquiring early users at scale, and creating the social proof and press needed to support ongoing GTM. A launch is not a one-time event; it's a repeatable motion you can run multiple times as you hit new milestones.

**Use when:**
- Your product is ready for public-facing acquisition (retention is working, onboarding is solid)
- You want to accelerate early growth beyond your personal network
- You're entering a new market segment or launching a major new feature

## Frameworks & Tools

**Staged Launch Sequence**
Don't go straight to public launch. Build momentum in stages:
1. *Private beta:* 20-50 hand-picked users. Collect feedback, fix critical issues, gather testimonials.
2. *Waitlist / limited access:* Create scarcity and FOMO. Collect emails for the public launch.
3. *Public beta:* Open but framed as "beta" — manages expectations and solicits feedback.
4. *GA (General Availability):* Full public launch with press, paid acquisition, and social proof in place.

**Product Hunt**
Best for B2B SaaS, developer tools, and productivity apps. Key factors for a strong launch:
- Recruit a well-connected "hunter" to submit your product (or submit it yourself)
- Build a following of supportive contacts before launch day
- Schedule for Tuesday-Thursday for highest traffic
- Coordinate upvotes and comments in the first 2 hours (this determines your daily ranking)
- Have a launch-day offer (discount, extended trial) to convert visitors

**Niche Press & Newsletter Strategy**
Identify 5-10 journalists or newsletter writers who cover your exact space. Don't blast a press release. Reach out individually with a specific, relevant angle — why this story matters to their audience right now. Offer exclusivity to your top target. Have your data, founder story, and customer quotes ready.

**Launch Metrics to Track**
- Signups / waitlist conversions on launch day and week
- Traffic sources (where did visitors come from?)
- Trial-to-paid conversion from launch cohort
- Press pickups and backlinks generated
- Social shares and organic mentions

**The Re-Launch**
Most successful products launch multiple times: initial launch, then re-launch on a milestone (first 1,000 customers, major new feature, funding announcement, award). Plan your re-launch moments in advance. Each one is an opportunity to reach a new audience with fresh social proof.
