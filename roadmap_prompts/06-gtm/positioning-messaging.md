# Positioning & Messaging
**Phase:** 6 — GTM | **Module:** 2 of 4

## Purpose

Defines how your product is positioned in the mind of your ICP relative to alternatives, and translates that positioning into words that convert. Good positioning makes every channel more effective. Bad positioning means you're explaining yourself on every sales call.

**Use when:**
- You're building your first marketing materials or sales deck
- Your conversion rate from landing page or sales calls is low
- You're entering a crowded market and need to differentiate clearly

## Frameworks & Tools

**April Dunford's Positioning Framework (Obviously Awesome)**
The most practical positioning framework for early-stage companies:
1. *Competitive alternatives:* What would your ICP do if you didn't exist? (Not just direct competitors — include the "do nothing" and "build it themselves" options)
2. *Unique attributes:* What do you have that alternatives genuinely don't?
3. *Value:* What value does that uniqueness enable for the customer?
4. *Target customers:* Who cares most about that specific value?
5. *Market category:* What frame of reference helps customers understand you fastest?

Work through these in order. Don't skip to messaging before completing positioning.

**The Messaging Hierarchy**
Once positioned, build your messaging in layers:
- *Category headline:* One sentence defining what you are and who it's for
- *Primary value proposition:* The main benefit, stated in terms of customer outcome (not features)
- *Three proof points:* Concrete, specific reasons to believe the value prop
- *Social proof:* Customer quotes, logos, case study results
- *CTA:* One clear next step

**Before / After / Bridge**
A simple narrative structure for messaging: *"Before [product], people with [problem] had to [painful current state]. After [product], they [desired outcome]. [Product] is the bridge."* Use this to write landing page copy, email subject lines, and ad creative.

**The 5-Second Test**
Show your landing page or headline to someone unfamiliar with your product. After 5 seconds, ask: what does this do? Who is it for? What do you do next? If they can't answer all three, your messaging isn't clear enough. Tools: UsabilityHub, Maze, or just a direct message to someone in your network.

**Messaging Consistency Check**
Your positioning should be consistent across: landing page headline, demo intro, sales email subject line, LinkedIn profile, and any ads. Inconsistency creates cognitive friction. Write a one-page messaging guide and use it as the source of truth for every customer-facing word.
