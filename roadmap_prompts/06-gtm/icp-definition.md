# ICP Definition
**Phase:** 6 — GTM | **Module:** 1 of 4

---

## Purpose

Defines the precise type of customer who gets maximum value from your product, converts quickly, stays long, and refers others. The tighter your ICP, the more effective every other GTM activity becomes — messaging, channel selection, sales conversations, and content.

**Use when:**
- You're moving from early traction to repeatable acquisition
- Your conversion rate or retention is inconsistent across customer types
- You're about to invest in a marketing or sales channel

## Frameworks & Tools

**ICP Definition Framework**
Build your ICP across four dimensions:

- *Firmographic (B2B):* Company size, industry, geography, funding stage, tech stack
- *Behavioral:* How they currently solve the problem, who makes the buying decision, what their buying process looks like
- *Psychographic:* Pain sensitivity, risk tolerance, attitude toward new tools, urgency
- *Trigger Events:* What just happened that makes them ready to buy right now? (new hire, funding round, regulation change, competitor failure, team growth milestone)

**The Anti-ICP**
Define explicitly who you are NOT for. This is as important as defining who you are for. Without an anti-ICP, your team will waste time on customers who will never be happy with your product — and who will generate churn, bad reviews, and support overhead.

**ICP Validation from Existing Data**
If you have any users or customers already, analyse them: who has the highest engagement? The lowest churn? The fastest time-to-value? The most referrals? Those are your real ICP — let the data confirm or challenge your assumptions.

**The ICP Hypothesis Test**
Write your ICP as a falsifiable statement: *"Our best customers are [specific description]. We know this because [observable behaviour or data]."* Then test it: does your next 10 customers who match this description perform better than those who don't? If yes, you've found your ICP. If not, refine.

**Trigger Event Prioritisation**
Of all your ICP dimensions, trigger events are the most actionable for outbound and content. If you know that companies who just hired a Head of Sales convert 3x better, you can build a list of companies that just made that hire and prioritise them. Tools for trigger events: LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Crunchbase alerts, job posting monitoring, funding announcement monitoring.
